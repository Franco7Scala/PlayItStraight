This repository contains the code and resources for the research paper "Play it Straight: An Intelligent Data Pruning Technique for Green-AI". Our proposed "Play It Straight" algorithm aims to reduce the computational and environmental costs of training AI models by strategically pruning the training dataset without compromising performance.

## Key Features

* **Green-AI Focus:** Employs intelligent data pruning to minimize the environmental footprint of AI model training;
* **Play It Straight Algorithm:** Introduces a novel algorithm combining active learning (AL) and repeated random sampling for effective dataset reduction;
* **Comparative Implementations:** Provides scripts for training models with the whole dataset, a pure AL approach, repeated random sampling, and the proposed "Play It Straight" algorithm;
* **Reproducibility:** Facilitates replication of our research results.

## Repository Structure

* **`play_it_straight/`:**
    * `main_play_it_straight.py`: Implements the proposed "Play It Straight" algorithm for model training.
